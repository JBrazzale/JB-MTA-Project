##MVP For WTWY Project
-My intention is to show the top 5 stations that WTWY can target. Here you will see that I have displayed 6 because I still need to filter out Grand Central Station
-This barplot only shows data for weekdays, as I believe the weekends will have too much tourist traffic.
-My data also contains data for all hours of the day. My finished project will omit the data from 12-4AM as it is not useful for our intended purpose. 
-I also plan on adding a heatmap that will show total volume for all stations based on the time of day.
