## WTWY MVP (Joseph Brazzale)
### 09/14/21 

- My intention is to show the top 5 stations that WTWY can target. Here you will see that I have displayed 6 because I still need to filter out Grand Central Station due to its high volume of tourists.
- I have selected data from 2019 because ridership was greatly impacted in 2020 due to the pandemic.
- This barplot only shows data for weekdays, as I believe the weekends will have too much tourist traffic.
- My data also contains data for all hours of the day. My finished project will omit the data from 12-4 AM as it is not useful for our intended purpose. 
- I also plan on adding a heatmap that will show the total volume for all stations based on the time of day.
